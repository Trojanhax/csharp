# Arrays in C#

An array in C# is a data structure that allows you to store multiple values of the same type under a single variable name. It provides a convenient way to work with collections of data, such as a list of numbers, strings, or objects.

## Declaration and Initialization:

```csharp
// Declaration and initialization of an array with 4 elements
string[] car = new string[4];
