# Logical Operators in C#

Logical operators in C# are used to perform logical operations on boolean operands (true or false). These operators are commonly used to combine or negate boolean expressions and make decisions based on multiple conditions.

## Logical AND (&&):

The logical AND operator (`&&`) returns true if both operands are true, otherwise it returns false.

```csharp
bool condition1 = true;
bool condition2 = false;
bool result = condition1 && condition2; // result = false
