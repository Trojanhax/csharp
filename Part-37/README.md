# Abstract Classes in C#

In C#, an abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is typically used as a base class for other classes. Abstract classes can contain a mix of abstract members (methods, properties, etc.) and concrete members, providing a blueprint for derived classes to implement or override.

## Syntax:

```csharp
abstract class AbstractClassName
{
    // Abstract method declaration
    public abstract void AbstractMethod();

    // Concrete method implementation
    public void ConcreteMethod()
    {
        // Method body
    }
}
