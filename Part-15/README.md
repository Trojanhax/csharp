# For Loop in C#

The for loop in C# is used to iterate over a range of values or elements in a collection. It provides a concise and structured way to execute a block of code repeatedly for a specified number of times.

## Syntax:

```csharp
for (initialization; condition; iteration)
{
    // Code block to execute in each iteration
}
