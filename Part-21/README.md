# Foreach Loop in C#

The foreach loop in C# is used to iterate over elements in a collection, such as an array or a collection object. It simplifies the process of iterating through each element of the collection without explicitly managing loop indices or bounds.

## Syntax:

```csharp
foreach (type variable in collection)
{
    // Code block to execute for each element in the collection
}
