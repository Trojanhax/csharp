# Constants in C#

In C#, constants are used to represent values that do not change during the execution of a program. Once defined, their value cannot be modified. Constants are useful for representing fixed values such as mathematical constants, configuration settings, or other values that should not change.

## Declaration and Initialization:

Constants in C# are declared using the `const` keyword. They must be initialized with a value at the time of declaration. Here's how you declare and initialize constants:

```csharp
// Declaration and initialization of constants
const int MaxValue = 100;
const double Pi = 3.14;
const string ApplicationName = "MyApp";
