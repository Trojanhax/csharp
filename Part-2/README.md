# Variables in C#

In C#, variables are used to store and manipulate data. They are essential components of any program. Here's an overview of variables in C#:

## Declaration and Initialization:

Variables in C# must be declared before they can be used. Declaration involves specifying the variable's data type and optionally assigning it an initial value.

```csharp
// Declaration and initialization
int age; // Declaring an integer variable
age = 30; // Initializing the variable with a value

string name = "John"; // Declaring and initializing a string variable
double height = 6.2; // Declaring and initializing a double variable
bool isStudent = true; // Declaring and initializing a boolean variable
