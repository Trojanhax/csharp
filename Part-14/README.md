# While Loop in C#

The while loop in C# is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. It's a pre-tested loop, meaning the condition is evaluated before the execution of the loop's body. The loop continues to execute as long as the condition remains true.

## Syntax:

```csharp
while (condition)
{
    // Code block to execute while the condition is true
    // The condition is evaluated before each iteration
    // If the condition is false, the loop terminates
}
