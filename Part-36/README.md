# Inheritance in C#

In C#, inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class, promoting code reuse and establishing hierarchical relationships between classes.

## Syntax:

```csharp
class BaseClass
{
    // Base class members
}

class DerivedClass : BaseClass
{
    // Derived class members
}
